                &nbsp;<p id="questions"><strong>Q: Where are you located and what areas are you servicing?</strong></p>

                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I am licensed and fully insured with $1 million of liability coverage.</p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: Who will be in my home?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Owner/Operator does all work. </p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: Do I have to be home?</strong></p>

                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: I work from home, is that problem?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> No, some customers are home and on the phone. We work with you starting upstairs or down, which ever is convenient.</p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: Why don't you list prices on your website?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Every house is different. Different sizes, shapes and location can all change the price of a job. To be fair, I would have to take a look at your home and properly evaluate what needs to be done.</p>

                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Imagine not worrying or even thinking about when and how you are going to find time to dust, vacuum, etc. Not to mention the bathrooms... You work hard all week and your time is too valuable.</p>
