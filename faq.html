                &nbsp;<p id="questions"><strong>Q: Where are you located and what areas are you servicing?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Pristine Pressure Washing is currently located in Royersford, PA. The business was established back in 2009, so this is our fifth year in business. The areas of service are Royersford, Collegeville, Phoenixville, Trappe, Limerick, Oaks, Audubon, King of Prussia, Norristown, Conshohocken, Wayne, Schwenksville, Plymouth Meeting, Pottstown, Skippack and other surrounding areas.</p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: Are you fully insured?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Yes I am fully insured with $1 million of liability coverage.</p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: Will you be using a pressure washer? I know they can do damage to a property if you do not use them the correct way.</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I will be using a pressure washer. You should be cautious in who you hire when looking to get your house cleaned because without the proper training a pressure washer can ruin whatever it is cleaning. A professional company will know the correct pressure to use and will clean everything at a safe distance.</p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: Will you be using chemicals when you clean my property?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, we will be using chemicals when cleaning your property. All of the chemicals we use will be environmental friendly. They will not harm your plants or yard.</p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: What is the dark staining on the sides of my home?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Most likely it is algae, mold or mildew. All of these like to grow on the sides of your home that get the least amount of sun and the highest humidity. These stains like to grow on vinyl siding, treated wood, glass, stone, bricks, etc.</p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: Why don't you list prices on your website?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Every house is different. Different sizes, shapes and location can all change the price of a job. To be fair, I would have to take a look at your home and properly evaluate what needs to be done.</p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: What are the benefits of having my house pressure washed?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> Having your house pressure washed can benefit your home in many ways. Right away you will be able to see a difference in how clean the house will look. The curb appeal of your house will go up because it is looking new again. It is also good for the health of you and your family. What is on the outside of your house can soon be going into the vents and ducts. The best way to stop or slow down this process is to keep the outside of your house mold and mildew free!</p>
                <p id="questions"><strong>Q: What sets Pristine Pressure Washing apart from other pressure washing companies in the area?</strong></p>
                <p id="answers"><strong>A:</strong> PPW is unique because we provide fast quotes, great communication and the best cleaning method out there. Quotes can be provided within 12 hours, most of the time a lot sooner. Communication is key in any relationship and responding quickly to your call or email is our top priority. Lastly, our cleaning method keeps your home safe and cleans better than using pressure.</p>&nbsp;
